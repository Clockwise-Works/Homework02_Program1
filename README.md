This program will use three different Seekbars displaying Red Green and Blue values, in which the user can slide them (Between 0-255). 
In turn the background will change to reflect this action. Once you have a color you like, you can click the Save Color button to add the
color to a listview below. Multiple colors can be stored, and if you wish to reselect one you had already saved, simply click on it to update
the current sliders to that color. Do not worry, if a color is too light then the text will automatically shift to black and if too dark they
will update to white.
